            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Got interested with Web Development through Shopify. Which I was first intruduced by a friend.
                As I was experimenting with their platform I came across how to change or add to a page through the HTML.
                And I got exposed to different tags like all the Header Tags and the &lt;iframe&gt; I was trying to embedd Gif's into a product page.
                But still having no skills and knowledge of HTML itself I was crippled and could not really do much.
                And everytime I wanted to change or fix the layout for my website I had to hire some developer to do it for me..
                And trust me they are not cheap.. yikes... 
            </p>
            <p>
                As I had no money for developers to fix ever occuring problems that a website comes with hurdle after hurdle.
                And not only this, also including not being able to keep up with Shopify's monthly payments. I made the best decsion in my life.
                That was to learn Web Development on my own! 
            </p>
            <p>
                I took up to learning to trade of Software Development on November 2020. And now I have come along way. 
                HTML5 and understandment of Semantic tags and non Semantic tags.
                Semantic tags are basically elements that defines its content like &lt;section&gt;&lt;main&gt; etc.
                While Non-Sematic are tags that does not define the content like &lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;
            </p>
            <p>
                Not only did I get very good with HTML5 I got good with CSS3 as well especially Flexbox and the CSS Grid layout for an entire page.
                And having the page responsive as well which is the most important about CSS3.
            </p>
            <p>
                The coding languages I have understood now to a great deal and I am pretty comfortable to code in are JavaScript and Python.
                Learned both vanilla JS and Python as well as their framework and libraries like React, Express etc.
